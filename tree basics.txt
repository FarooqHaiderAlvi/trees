height starting from zero
so if height is zero then no of nodes is 1

no of nodes = (2^h)-1

height of tree=log(n+1) with base 2

if there are n nodes then there must be n-1
edges

A tree is an acyclic graph.

There are two main types of tree traversal.

breath first search which is also known as
level order traversal.
and second is depth first search which further has three types
lvr , lrv , vlr


for breath first we use queue and for dfs we use stack in its three types
