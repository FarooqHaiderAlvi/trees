height starting from zero
so if height starts from zero then use this formula to calculate total nodes

max no of nodes = (2^h+1)-1
min no of nodes= h+1
min height = log(n+1)-1
max height = n-1

else if height start from 1 use this formula
max no of nodes = (2^h)-1
min no of nodes =h
min height of tree=log(n+1) with base 2
max height of tree=n
if there are n nodes then there must be n-1
edges

A tree is an acyclic graph.

There are two main types of tree traversal.

breath first search which is also known as
level order traversal.
and second is depth first search which further has three types
lvr , lrv , vlr


for breath first we use queue and for dfs we use stack in its three types.

------------------

Perfect BT:
each node has exactly zero or two nodes.
All leaf nodes are at the same level.

---------------

full binary tree:
each node has exactly zero or two nodes 
it is not necessary that all leaf nodes are at the same level

---------------------
Complete binary tree

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.

A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences

All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.

-----------------------


in binary tree linkedlist implementation we can
make a friend class for treeNode that contain lft and 
right pointers

-------------------------

when we apply inordertraversal(lvr) on bst we get sorted values from min to max

--------------------------------


for bst worst case time complexity is O(height) 
for following funcitons
insert
findmin
findmax
delete
search

---------------------------------------


Heaps

heaps are binary tree and complete binary tree and have heap property.

and in min heap, deletions is always done from the minimum value that is root
and in max heap deletion is always done from the highest value that is root

-----------------------------------------


avl are types of height balance tree or a technique to balance binary search tree there are many other height balance trees like red-black trees, 2-3 trees

O(H)=O(n) when bst becomes right or left skewed
