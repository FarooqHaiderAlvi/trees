AVL TREE

OPERATION	BEST CASE	AVERAGE CASE	WORST CASE
Insert	        O (log n)	O (log n)	O (log n)
Delete	        O (log n)	O (log n)	O (log n)
Search	        O (1)	        O (log n)	O (log n)
 

The time complexity of all binary tree travesals is O(n) because each node is visited in every traveral only 
the order in which nodes are visited differs.
